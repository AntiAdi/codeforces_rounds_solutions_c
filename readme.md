Hello and welcome to my solutions of codeforces rounds in C language.


1. I will try my absolute best to cover solutions for all the questions for the rounds as fast as possible. However be assured that all the solutions will be covered in the meantime if not yet.

2. A lots of comments will be added in the source code of the solutions itself. So the solutions are fully packed in themselves.

3. The problem statements will be given in a seperate folder as text as well as image formats. The corrosponding links will be added as well.

4. The solutions will be checked by myself to satisfy 100% of the problem statement requirements. However, Any suggestions are welcomed.
